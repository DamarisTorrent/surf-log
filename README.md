## About SurfLog 

SurfLog is an all in one app to document your progress as a surfer. With SurfLog, you can journal about each time you hit the waves, and store real-time and historical data about wave conditions. This will not only allow you to narrow down the best surf spots, but track your growth as a surfer. In the future, it will also allow you to store photos of memorable moments.
